## 一边倒例文

【Introduction】

  &ensp;&ensp;<font class="font-pink">In my opinion</font>, employees should be given at least four weeks of holiday time each year. While some may argue that holiday time may not directly improve job performance, <font class="font-blue">I believe that it is essential for</font> ensuring a healthy work-life balance and can ultimately lead to better job performance.

【Body Paragraphs】

  &ensp;&ensp;<font class="font-pink">Firstly</font>, taking time off work allows employees to rest and recharge. When employees are constantly working without taking adequate breaks, they can experience burnout, <font class="font-blue">which can lead to</font> decreased motivation and productivity at work. <font class="font-blue">By</font> providing employees with four weeks of holiday time, employers can help ensure that their workers are well-rested and ready to tackle their job responsibilities when they return.

  &ensp;&ensp;<font class="font-pink">Secondly</font>, holidays can provide opportunities for personal growth and development. <font class="font-blue">For instance</font>, during a holiday, employees may choose to engage in activities that can help them develop new skills or pursue their passions. These experiences can help employees gain new perspectives and insights that they can bring back to their work, which can ultimately lead to improved job performance.

  &ensp;&ensp;<font class="font-pink">Finally</font>, offering four weeks of holiday time can demonstrate an employer's commitment to their employees' well-being. When workers feel that their employer values their health and happiness, they are more likely to be loyal and motivated to perform well in their jobs. <font class="font-blue">This can lead to</font> increased job satisfaction and overall performance.

【Conclusion】

  &ensp;&ensp;<font class="font-pink">In conclusion</font>, <font class="font-blue">I strongly believe that</font> employees should be given at least four weeks of holiday time each year. By providing workers with the opportunity to rest and recharge, employers can help ensure that their employees are well-prepared to perform their job responsibilities. Additionally, offering holiday time can demonstrate an employer's commitment to their employees' well-being, which can lead to increased job satisfaction and performance.

## 让步型例文

  &ensp;&ensp;As a college student, I can understand why some people might think that living with parents is a good idea. <font class="font-blue">After all（让步论点）</font>, parents can provide emotional and financial support, and they can offer valuable guidance as we navigate the challenges of college life. <font class="font-blue">However（突出主要论点）</font>, I must say that I firmly believe that it is better for college students to live independently. In my opinion, the benefits of living on our own far outweigh the advantages of living with parents.

【让步段】

  &ensp;&ensp;Living with parents during college can certainly have its advantages. <font class="font-blue">For one thing（一方面）</font>, parents can offer financial support, which can be a significant concern for many college students. <font class="font-blue">Additionally（另外）</font>, parents can provide a sense of stability and security, which can be especially important during times of stress or uncertainty. They can also offer valuable advice and guidance, which can be helpful as we make important decisions about our future.

【强调段】

  &ensp;&ensp;<font class="font-pink">Despite</font> these benefits, I believe that it is better for college students not to live with their parents. Living independently allows us to develop important life skills, such as budgeting, time management, and self-discipline. When we are responsible for our own lives, we learn to take care of ourselves and become more self-reliant. Additionally, living independently allows us to establish our own identity and explore the world around us. We can meet new people, experience different cultures, and broaden our horizons in ways that would not be possible if we were living with our parents.

【强调段】

  &ensp;&ensp;<font class="font-pink">Furthermore</font>, living independently during college can be a powerful step towards adulthood. When we live with our parents, we are often defined by our relationship to them, which can be limiting. By living on our own, we can begin to establish ourselves as independent individuals with our own goals, aspirations, and values. This can help us to become better prepared for the challenges of adulthood, and it can help us to achieve our goals and aspirations.

  &ensp;&ensp;<font class="font-pink">In conclusion</font>, while living with parents can have its advantages, <font class="font-blue">I believe that it is better</font> for college students to live independently. Living on our own allows us to develop important life skills, explore the world around us, and become better prepared for the challenges of adulthood. While it may be difficult at times, the benefits of living independently during college are well worth the effort.
