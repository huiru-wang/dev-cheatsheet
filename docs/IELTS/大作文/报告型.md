These programs can help to provide a sense of belonging and purpose to young people, which can reduce their likelihood of engaging in criminal activities. <font class="font-pink">Finally</font>, law enforcement agencies can work to increase their presence in areas where teenage crime is prevalent, and take a proactive approach to identifying and addressing potential criminal activities before they occur.
