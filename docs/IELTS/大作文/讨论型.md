# 讨论型
讨论型作文：话题中一般给出两个相对应的观点，然后给出问题：<font class="font-blue">Discuss both views and give your own opinion.</font>

## 审题思路
- 不需要自己找论点，直接使用题目给出的两个论点：论述观点的正确性，不能论述错误性！
- 一定要**在最后**给出个人观点(同意/反对)；

## 行文结构
1、开篇：不需要给出个人看法，只需要陈述要讨论的问题；即：复述两个预设的观点；

2、Discuss First views，论述第一个观点；给出充分论据；(**必须第三视角**)

3、Discuss Second views，论述第二个观点；给出充分论据；(**必须第三视角**)

4、give your own opinion：发表出个人的同意/反对的观点；(**必须第一视角**)

5、总结段；两个观点和个人观点各简述一下；

---
1-2-1：
个人观点 和 总阶段融合，此时必须保持中立态度；

1-2-1-1：
个人观点单独一段，可以让步，可以共存：
- 让步型：虽然...但是...更重要；给出额外的论点讨论；✅推荐
- 共存型：两种都非常重要，缺一不可；

> Introduction:

&ensp;&ensp;In recent years, the issue of improving public health <font class="font-blue">has become a growing concern</font>. While some people argue that increasing the number of sports facilities is the best way to achieve this goal, others believe that other measures should be implemented. In this essay, <font class="font-blue">I will discuss both views and provide my own opinion.</font>

> Body Paragraph 1:

&ensp;&ensp;<font class="font-pink">On the one hand</font>, those who advocate for increasing the number of sports facilities argue that regular physical activity is essential for good health. They believe that having more facilities such as parks, gyms, and sports centers will encourage people to be more active, which will lead to a decrease in the incidence of lifestyle diseases such as obesity and heart disease. Furthermore, sports facilities can provide a sense of community and social support, which can also contribute to better health outcomes.

> Body Paragraph 2:

&ensp;&ensp;<font class="font-pink">On the other hand</font>, those who oppose the idea of increasing sports facilities argue that there are other measures that can be more effective in improving public health. For instance, some people suggest that government policies such as regulating the food industry and increasing access to healthcare services <font class="font-blue">can have a greater impact on</font> health outcomes than just building more sports facilities.<font class="font-pink"> Additionally</font>, some argue that not everyone can afford to use sports facilities or has the time to<font class="font-blue"> engage in </font>regular exercise due to work or family obligations.

> Body Paragraph 3:

> Indeed, it is also important to implement other...., but I believe that increasing the number of sports facilities 

&ensp;&ensp;<font class="font-pink">In my opinion, both views have valid points, but I believe that increasing the number of sports facilities should be prioritized</font>. Regular physical activity is essential for good health, and having more sports facilities can provide people with the opportunity to engage in different types of activities that suit their preferences and lifestyles. However, it is also important to implement other measures such as regulating the food industry and increasing access to healthcare services to complement the benefits of physical activity.

Conclusion:

&ensp;&ensp;<font class="font-pink">In conclusion</font>, improving public health is a complex issue that requires a multi-faceted approach. While increasing the number of sports facilities can be an effective way to promote physical activity, it should be accompanied by other measures to address the various factors that influence public health outcomes.
